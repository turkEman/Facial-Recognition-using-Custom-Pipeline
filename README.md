# Facial-Recognition-using-Custom-Pipeline
Project integrates two models: YOLOv11n for gender detection and EfficientNet_V2_S for celebrity recognition. YOLO, trained on ~2,000 images, achieved high precision (85.7%) for gender classification. EfficientNet, fine-tuned with MixUp and data augmentation, reached over 99% accuracy for 16 celebrity identities, creating an efficient pipeline.
